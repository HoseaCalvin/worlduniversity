# WorldUniversity

WorldUniversity is a  website where users search for specific countries, both recognized and unrecognized, and their details.

## Objective

There are notable content creators who give street quizzes about geography to strangers. Unfortunately, most of those who get asked struggle to answer them due to lack of global awareness.
To solve the problem, I need to an engaging and unique way, to promote geography via an accessible platform.
Hence, I developed WorldUniversity to encourage students, adventurers, geography enthusiasts, and others alike, to explore various countries and territories around the world.
Who knows if you could win some money from simply answering one question right?
