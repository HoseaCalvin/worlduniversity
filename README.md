# WorldUniversity

WorldUniversity is a website where users can search and learn sovereign and non-sovereign states and their details.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

With the recent trend of random geography street quiz on social media, I am dedicated to promoting geography and the splendor of each nation in an accessible and interactive way.

Hence, I developed "WorldUniversity", a website where students, adventurers, geography enthusiasts, and like-minded individuals can explore and learn about each nation.

WorldUniversity highlights vital aspects of a country such as the national flag, the capital city, and more that definitely spark curiosity and keep learners engaged. Moreover, these are oftentimes asked by most content creators, so you won't have to worry about being asked anymore.
