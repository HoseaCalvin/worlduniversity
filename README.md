# WorldUniversity

WorldUniversity is a  website where users search for specific countries, both recognized and unrecognized, and their details.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

With the recent trend of random geography street quiz, I am deeply passionate about promoting geography and the splendor of each nation in an accessible and interactive way.

Hence, I developed a website named "WorldUniversity" where students, adventurers, geography enthusiasts, and like-minded individuals can explore and learn about each nation.

WorldUniversity highlights vital aspects of a country like the national flag, the location, and more that definitely spark curiosity and keep learners engaged.
